## The updated replit and GitHub repo for small projects.


It looks like this will be easier if you *start* with the replit, then create the GitHub repo from the replit.

This strategy should maintain the replit as an HTML/CS/JS replit, preserving the page launch functionality when you click the Run button.

Navigate to the **Version Control** panel, and click the **Create a Git Repo** button (rather than connecting to an existing git repository.)   Name the repo **it202-spr22-pages**

After replit completes the creation, navigate to GitHub and enable GitHub pages on this repo.
